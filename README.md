Simple HTML5 homerun game made with phaser.io

This is a very simple responsive HTML5 homerun game.
The only dependency is the phaser.io framework which can be found here: https://phaser.io/
Phaser is a free 2d game engine with no 3D support. However, we can replicate a ball flying in the third dimension simply by changing the size of the image in the sprite sheet.
